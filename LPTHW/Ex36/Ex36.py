# Designing and Debugging
1. Every if-statement must have an else.
2. If this 'else' should never run because it doesn't make sense, then you must use die function in the else that print
    out an error message and dies, just like we did in the last exercise. This will find many errors.
3. Never nest if-statements more than two deep and always try to do them one deep.
4. Treat if-statement like paragraphs, where each if-elif-else grouping like a set of sentences. Put blank lines before
    and after.
5. Your boolean test should be simple. If they are complex, move their calculates to variables earlier in your function
    and use a good name for the variable.
